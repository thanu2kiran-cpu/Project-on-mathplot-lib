# Project-on-mathplot-lib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It provides a flexible and powerful API for generating a wide variety of plots such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, heatmaps, and more.  
🛒 Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis (Pandas Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior using Python and Pandas. The aim is to clean raw e-commerce data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract meaningful business insights, and prepare a final clean dataset to support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis helps understand customer trends, purchasing patterns, and revenue distribution across demographics such as age, gender, location, season, and product category.

🎯 Objectives

Understand customer purchasing behavior

Clean and preprocess raw e-commerce data

Perform feature engineering

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate business insights using visualizations

Prepare an analysis-ready dataset

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level purchase information with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Customer ID	Unique customer identifier
Age	Age of the customer
Gender	Gender of the customer
Item Purchased	Product purchased
Category	Product category
Purchase Amount (USD)	Purchase value
Location	Customer location
Color	Product color
Season	Season of purchase
Review Rating	Customer rating
Subscription Status	Subscription details
Shipping Type	Shipping mode
Discount Applied	Discount applied or not
Promo Code Used	Promo code usage
Previous Purchases	Count of past purchases
Payment Method	Mode of payment
🛠️ Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Understanding & Inspection

Checked data types and structure

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Corrected data formats

Removed inconsistencies

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Created new features such as:

Signup Month

Signup Week

Purchase Status (Yes / No)

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Age vs Purchase Amount

Gender-wise purchase count

Category-wise revenue

Monthly revenue trends

Discount and promo code impact

Subscription vs repeat purchases

5️⃣ Business Insights

Identified customers who signed up but never purchased

Found cities with the highest revenue

Analyzed age groups with highest average purchase

Calculated percentage of low-value purchases

Studied impact of discounts and subscriptions

6️⃣ Final Dataset

No missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Clean, analysis-ready dataset

📊 Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

Bar charts

Line plots

Count plots

Box plots

Pie charts

Heatmaps

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly represent trends and patterns.

🔍 Key Insights

Certain age groups contribute higher average purchase amounts

Discounts and promo codes influence customer buying behavior

Subscription customers show higher repeat purchases

Revenue varies significantly across locations

Seasonal trends impact sales
